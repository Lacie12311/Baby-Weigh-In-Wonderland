# Baby-Weigh-In-Wonderland

## Description

This project is a C program designed to analyze the weights of babies in different age categories. The program collects weight data for newborns, six-month-old babies, and one-year-old babies, then calculates and displays the total and average weights for each group. The goal is to provide a clear overview of baby weights, offering insights into the growth and development of infants.

### Features

- **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter the number of babies in each age category and their respective weights.
- **Data Analysis**: Computes the total and average weights for newborns, six-month-old babies, and one-year-old babies.
- **Output**: Displays the total and average weights for each age category, along with the combined total weight for all babies.

This program demonstrates basic data handling, array usage, and arithmetic operations in C, providing a practical example of applying programming skills to solve real-world problems.
